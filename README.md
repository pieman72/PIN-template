PIN-template
===

I recently set up [PIN](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool)
for a recent research project, and encountered a few snags along the way. Here
are some step-by-step instructions for what I had to do to get started. Also
included is a template cpp file for creating a custom PIN tool.
